This error occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook or similar async storage methods within a component that is remounted frequently.  The asynchronous nature of these methods, coupled with rapid component re-rendering, can lead to race conditions where the component attempts to access the data before it's fully fetched.
