# Expo useAsyncStorage Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition that can occur when using Expo's `useAsyncStorage` hook within a component that remounts frequently.  The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of `useAsyncStorage` and the rapid re-renders causing stale data or undefined values.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` provides a solution utilizing techniques to mitigate the race condition.

## Problem

Rapid component remounting, coupled with asynchronous data fetching using `useAsyncStorage`, can lead to a race condition.  This means that the component attempts to use the data before the asynchronous operation is complete, leading to `undefined` values or accessing stale data.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the component's lifecycle and asynchronous operations.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates strategies to avoid this problem, providing a more robust and reliable approach for using asynchronous data fetching in a component that may remount frequently.
